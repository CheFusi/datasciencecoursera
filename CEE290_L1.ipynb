If you'd like to use traditional R and R Studio for your personal use, it's free to download from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ but for easy access to your scripts for debugging purposes, we'll work on Colab for this class. Please save a copy of this Colab in your drive so that you have your own copy to work with. Although it should already be set up to run R, you can check by going to \"Runtime\" on the top toolbar and selecting \"Change runtime type.\" Runtime type should be selected as R in the dropdown menu."

For example, this box is a text chunk where you can write/edit text to describe things. Code chunks, like the one below, have a little play sign to the left of the chunk, which will allow you to \"run\" those chunks in order to execute the code that's contained in the chunk. Try running the below calculation by pressing the play button. You can also press CTRL + Enter in order to run the chunk you've selected as well."
